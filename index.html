                <p class="indent"><span class="intro">M</span>icrosoft has decided to implement a feature to new Windows 10 Creators Update. It's called <q>Game Mode</q>. What it does is turning your <font color="darkgray"><b>barebone</b></font> PC into a <i>powerhouse.</i> This means you could be able to play games that run poorly to great-ish. People loved that Microsoft was finally doing something for <b>budget gamers</b> but when the public got the Creators Update it was a whole different story.</p>
                
                <blockquote>"When you use Game Mode, we make gaming your PC's top priority so you get the best game quality and performance." - Microsoft</blockquote>
                
                <p class="indent">Once Windows 10 users got the latest update they noticed something with there FPS—Frames Per Second. <mark>It was going down-hill instead of improving Frames.</mark> People still have no idea why this happens, but hopefully Microsoft intends on fixing it soon.</p>

                <p class="indent"><span class="intro">T</span>he update 18.04 LTS is <u>removing Unity and replacing it with GNOME.</u> Seems like a great way of giving the user a new desktop look and layout (not the same old one). I do understand that a small portion of people don't like the change of it, but look at it as a new start. Users that did not like the style of Unity, probably will change to Ubuntu because of its <b>removal.</b></p>
                
                <p class="indent"><span class="overline">As an avid user of Ubuntu</span> I personally had no problem with Unity and did <span class="shadow">kinda</span> like the design. I am happy that Ubuntu did decide to do this switch and I would never actually think they would use it in a million years.</p>

                <p class="indent">I was thinking about maybe making it an <q>open source</q> blog (meaning anyone could write something), or just a regular old blog about my <i>interests.</i> Until the time comes we have to wait to see what will happen in the end.</p>
