                <p class="indent"><span class="intro">T</span>he update 18.04 LTS is <u>removing Unity and replacing it with GNOME.</u> Seems like a great way of giving the user a new desktop look and layout (not the same old one). I do understand that a small portion of people don't like the change of it, but look at it as a new start. Users that did not like the style of Unity probably will change to Ubuntu sense of its <b>removal.</b></p>
                
                <p class="indent"><span class="overline">As an avid user of Ubuntu</span> I personally had no problem with Unity and did <span class="shadow">kinda</span> like the design. I am happy that Ubuntu did decide to do this switch and I would never actually think they would use it in a million years.</p>

                <p class="indent"><span class="intro">T</span>o start off, thank you for taking the time to start reading this webpage/blog of sorts. Secondly, you might have some questions about what this blog is all about. Well<span id="..."></span> I don't know either—such a great beginning.</p>
                
                <p class="indent">I was thinking about maybe making it an <q>open source</q> blog (meaning anyone could write something), or just a regular old blog about my <i>interests.</i> Until the time comes we have to wait to see what will happen in the end.</p>
